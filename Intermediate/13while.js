//we will deal with while loop
//while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times
//or until a certain condition is met
//in while loop we first initialize and then inside it we will write a block of code in it .and incrementing will also be there
// let i=0;
// while(i<5)
// {
//     console.log(i);
//     i++;
// }
