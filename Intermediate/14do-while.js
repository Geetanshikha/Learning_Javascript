///we will gonna deal with do-while
//do-while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times
//it will first print and then gonna ceck for the condition

// let i=0;
// do{
//     console.log(i);
//     i++;
// }while(i<10)

//now let's see if the condition is not met than what will happen 
let i=45;
do{
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}while(i<10)
    //it will run one time still the condition is false
