//now here we will create a function that is self anonymous function 
//ohk so this function is not having name 
//and this function only requires declaration no calling 
//()(); //major syntax 
(
    function() {
    console.log("Hello");
    console.log("sayhello");

})();

//no calling needed 

//and now we also know that function can also be put into variables so we can read for functional programming of hitesh bhaiya to get to know more about concepts
var user1 = function(){
    console.log("hello");
    console.log("hii,i am geet");
}
